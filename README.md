# Capstone Project: Smart Finance Analyzer

A command-line tool that manages financial transactions, generates reports, and provides insights into spending patterns.

## Setup
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install the `tabulate` library: `pip install tabulate`.
4. Run the program with `python main.py`.

## Features

- Load transactions from `financial_transactions.csv`, validating uniqueness of transaction IDs.
- Add transactions with input validation and customer ID suggestions.
- View transactions in a paginated table (10 per page), with filters for type (credit/debit/transfer) and year.
- Update transactions by ID, editing date, customer ID, amount, type, or description.
- Delete transactions by ID with confirmation.
- Analyze financial summaries (credits, debits, transfers, net balance).
- Save transactions to CSV and generate a text report.
- Generate detailed financial reports saved to text files (`report_YYYYMMDD.txt`) including:
  - Date range and total transactions.
  - Financial summary (credits, debits, transfers, net balance).
  - Breakdown by transaction type (count and percentage).
  - Yearly and quarterly breakdowns (credits, debits, transfers, net balance, counts).
  - Top 5 customers by transaction volume.
  - Year-over-year growth for credits, debits, and net balance.
  - Anomaly detection for unusual transaction amounts (>3 standard deviations from mean).
- Logs errors to `errors.txt` and successful operations (load, save, add, update, delete, report) plus empty transaction attempts to `activity.txt`.
- Comprehensive input validation, error handling (e.g., file I/O, invalid data), and support for large datasets (e.g., 100,001 transactions).

## Bonus Features

- Creates timestamped backups of the input CSV in `snapshots/` on load.
- Supports year-based filtering for transaction views.
- Generates detailed reports with statistics.
- Uses [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) for formatted table output.
- Includes unit tests and a data-generator.

## Dependencies
- `tabulate` (`pip install tabulate`): For formatted table output in the CLI.
- (Optional) `faker` (`pip install faker`): For generating test data in `csv_faker.py`.
- (Optional) `colorama` (`pip install colorama`): For colorized console output (cyan menu, green success, yellow headers, red errors). Falls back to plain text if not installed.

## Files

- `utils.py`: Contains `FinanceUtils` class with core logic for transaction management.
- `main.py`: Provides a menu-driven user interface.
- `financial_transactions.csv`: Stores transaction data.
- `errors.txt`: Logs errors during execution.
- `activity.txt`: Logs info messages and program operations.
- `report_YYYYMMDD.txt`: Outputs financial summary reports.
- `snapshots/`: Stores timestamped CSV backups.
- `csv_faker.py`: Generates test data using the Faker library (`pip install faker`).
- `test_finance_utils.py`: Runs unit tests for file handling and validation [TBD].

## Usage

1. Ensure `financial_transactions.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tabulate
    ```

    Install optional dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install faker colorama
    ```

3. Run `python main.py` and select options 1â€“9 from the menu to manage transactions.

## Testing

- **Generate Test Data**: Run `python csv_faker.py` to create sample financial data tailored to a rural household spending.
- **Run Unit Tests**: Execute `python test_finance_utils.py` to verify functionality, with descriptive console output for each test.
